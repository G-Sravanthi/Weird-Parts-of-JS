# The Weird Parts of JavaScript
## Definition
### Object:

```
A collection of properties with key/value pairs or methods which are declared functions within the object's collection.  An object can also have a collection that is another obkect.  
```
###Object Literal:

```
When the Js Engine is parsing through your code and comes upon `{}` outside of a function or conditional, the JS Engine assumes that a new object is being created.  Object literal syntax allows the programmer to create an object in the fly with `{}` whenever wanted.  
```
